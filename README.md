# IMBD-Dashboard-Creation
The dataset is in the form of Excel sheet.
The second sheet has question that are to  be work on using the IMDB dataset.
I have worked on this dataset in Microsoft Excel Sheet.
In this dataset I have created different sheets for each answer. The sheets are renamed as the question number except the one dashboard sheet.
